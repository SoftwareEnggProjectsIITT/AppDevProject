1. if image is not found from general pattern, look for images from twitter
2. if still no image found, put one image from our library to match the classification of the post

some errors, but I dont want to fix:
--> get_ids.py: the html file has some very long lines which overflow to create some error
--> some posts have wierd table format and body comes distorted, fix that
